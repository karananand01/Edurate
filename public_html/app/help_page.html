            <h1>How to Use Edurate?</h1>
            Edurate is a website that aims to serve the students and faculty of universities by providing
            a revolutionary platform that encourages strengthened communication.
            Signing up for Edurate is as easy as can be. Clicking on the button to Sign up as a
            first time user will take you to the account creation page that requires a unique username, password
            ( hashed and salted for your protection ), name, and university to make an account. You can indicate
            whether you are a professor by flipping the toggle.
            Logging in is just as simple as creating your account. All you need to do is enter your username and
            password in the login page. Once again, professors are reqiured to flip the toggle.<br><br>
            <h2>Edurate for students</h2>
            Edurate helps college students make better informed decisions about their education and allows them
            to provide real-time feedback to their professors indicating an issue or concern. When you log in to
            Edurate as a student you are able to search for courses by a substring of the course overview, or by
            searching for professors. If you choose to enter the course page of a course you have searched for,
            you can read the course overview and previous ratings and reviews written by students. You can also leave
            your
            own rating and review of the course for anyone else to look at. However, if you wish to express a current
            concern or issue only to the professor in an anonymous fashion, you can send a direct message which is
            only visible to the professor of the course. Clicking on the home tab in the navigation bar on top
            of the page brings you back to the search page. If you visit a professor's home page you can read up
            about the professor and take a look at all the courses they are involved with.
            <h2>Edurate for professors</h2>
            Edurate is a useful tool for professors to gather feedback about their courses, and is also helpful
            in understanding how their students are feeling at present. This can help an educator re-shape the
            structure of their course and implement changes in the current or future semesters. When you log
            in to Edurate as a professor, you are taken to your own home page which can be personalized by
            adding a profile photo and editing your information. You can also create unique courses in your
            home page and access them from your list of courses. When you enter a course page, you are able
            to edit the course overview and read public reviews as well as privately submitted Direct Messages.
            While public reviews on a course page are permanent, you have the ability to delete Direct Messages.
